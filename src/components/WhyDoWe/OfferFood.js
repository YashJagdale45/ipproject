            Western tradition food is partaken after a thanksgiving prayer -
            grace. Indians make an offering of it to the Lord, and later partake
            of it as prasada - a holy gift from the Lord. In temples and in many
            homes, the cooked food is first offered to the Lord, each day. The
            offered food is mixed with the rest of the food and then served as
            prasada. In our daily ritualistic worship (pūjā) too, we offer
            <b> naivedyam</b> (food) to the Lord.

          <p>
            The Lord is omnipotent and omniscient. All that we do is by His
            strength and knowledge alone. Being the Totality, all that we
            receive in life as a result of our actions is really His alone. We
            acknowledge this through the act of offering food to Him. This is
            exemplified by the famous ärati words in Hindi - terä tujhako arpana
            - 'I offer what is Yours to You'. Thereafter, what is received is
            His gift to us (prasada), graced by His divine touch. tube

          <p>Knowing this, our entire attitude to food and the act of eating changes. The food offered is pure and the best and shared with others, before consuming. We do not demand, complain or criticise the quality of the food we get. We do not waste or reject it. We eat it with a cheerful acceptance (prasada buddhi). When we become established in this attitude, we are then able to cheerfully accept all we get in life, as His prasada.

          Before we partake of our daily meals, we first sprinkle water around the plate as an act of purification. Five morsels of food are placed on the side of the plate acknowledging the debt owed by us to a) divine forces (devată ṛṇa) - for their benign grace and protection, b) our ancestors (pitr rna) - for giving us their lineage and a family culture, c) the sages (rsi rna) - as our religion and culture have been 'realised', maintained and handed down to us by them. d) our fellow beings (manusya ma) - who constitute the society, without the support of which we could not live as we do, e) other living beings (bhūta rna) - for serving us selflessly

            Children are also strongly discouraged from touching people with
            their feet. Even if this happens accidentally, we touch the person
            and bring the fingers to our eyes as a mark of apology. Even when
            elders touch a younger person inadvertently with their feet, they
            immediately apologise.

            To touch another with the feet is considered an act of misdemeanor.
            Why is this so?

            Man is regarded as the most beautiful, living, breathing temple of
            the Lord. Therefore, touching another with the feet is akin to
            disrespecting the divinity within him or her. This calls for an
            immediate apology, which is offered with reverence and humility.

            Thus, many of our customs are designed to be simple but powerful
            reminders or pointers of profound philosophical truths. This is one
            of the factors that has kept Indian culture alive across centuries.
